# Stochastic Logistic Growth Model for Cell Populations

This repository contains Python implementations of stochastic
birth–death and logistic growth models inspired by bacterial
and cancer cell population dynamics.

## Models
- Stochastic birth–death model
- Density-dependent logistic growth
- Gene expression noise model (Poisson-based)

## Tools
Python, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Motivation
Developed as a self-initiated project to explore how mathematical
and computational approaches can describe biological systems.
